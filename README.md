# Deep-Learning-for-Natural-Language-Processing

ðŸ’¡ðŸ§ ðŸ’¬ Development of Deep Learning models using Feedforward Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment classification tasks. A Question Answering Engine used for Entity Span and Relation prediction is also developed.

## FNN

- Sentiment classification of [imdb reviews](imdb-reviews.csv) using Feedforward Neural Networks.

## RNN-LSTM-GRU

- Sentiment classification of [imdb reviews](imdb-reviews.csv) using bidirectional stacked RNNs with LSTM/GRU cells.

## BERT

- Sentiment classification of [imdb reviews](imdb-reviews.csv) by fine-tuning a pretrained BERT-base model from Hugging Face.

## Question-Answering

- Development of a question answering engine for simple questions over the knowledge graph Wikidata: Entity Span and Relation Prediction (dataset: https://github.com/askplatypus/wikidata-simplequestions)
